    <h1 id="para">Hi guys , this website will tell you how you can 
        start malware anlysis:)
    </h1>
    <br>
<p>What is malware anlysis ?
</p>
<p>
    first thing if you dont know what is malware anlysis so i will tell you , malware means harmful code that are made for the purpose of harming you'r system , 
        and anlysis means understanding the malware like how it was create ,how we can stop it .  
        
</p>
<h2>Types of malware:-</h2>
<br>
<ol>
    <li>
        Trojan
    </li>
    <li>Virus</li>
    <li>Ransomeware</li>
    <li>Botnet</li>
    <li>Adware</li>
    <li>Rootkit</li>
    <li>Worms</li>
    <li>Trojan</li>
</ol>
<br>
<p>These are the Types of malwares,and now i will tell you about types of Malware Analysis Techniques:-</p>
<br>
<ol>
    <li>Static Anlysis :- static analysis consists of examining the executable file without viewing the
        actual instructions. Basic static analysis can confirm whether a file is malicious,
        provide information about its functionality, and sometimes provide information
        that will allow you to produce simple network signatures.  static analysis is
        straightforward and can be quick, but it’s largely ineffective against sophisticated
        malware, and it can miss important behaviors.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>Dynamic Analysis:-dynamic analysis techniques involve running the malware and observing its
        behavior on the system in order to remove the infection, produce effective
        signatures, or both. However, before you can run malware safely, you must set up
        an environment that will allow you to study the running malware without risk of
        damage to your system or network. Like basic static analysis techniques, basic
        dynamic analysis techniques can be used by most people without deep
        programming knowledge, but they won’t be effective with all malware and can
        miss important functionality.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Advanced Static Analysis:-Advanced static analysis consists of reverse-engineering the malware’s internals by
            loading the executable into a disassembler and looking at the program instructions
            in order to discover what the program does.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Advanced Dynamic Analysis:-Advanced dynamic analysis uses a debugger to examine the internal state of a
                running malicious executable. Advanced dynamic analysis techniques provide
                another way to extract detailed information from an executable. These techniques
                are most useful when you’re trying to obtain information that is difficult to gather
                with the other techniques.</li>


</ol>
<h>Skills need for malware anlysis are as follows:-</h>
<br>
<p>1.Learn some programming like :- python,java,assembly.c++,c,etc..
   2.Learn reverse-engineering
   3.learn how to use ida pro 
   4.Learn to Examine Malicious Scripts and Document Files
   5.Practise and Practise , take an malware sample from malware bazzar website or any other website and just try to get information about that malware , execute malware on 
   safe environment not in host os.
