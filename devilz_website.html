   <em>Now the first topic starts here that how you can find bugs like an pro hacker :-
    
   </em>
   <br>
   <ol>
    <li>First,Keep in mind that never change you are program again and again i know some beginners who just find program and just start hunting by leaving the phase of information gathering  , information gathering is very important for hackers , don't worry if you don't get any bug in one day just keep getting information about you'r target like what technology they are using,what ports are open , what versions they are using etc... </li>
    <br>
    <li>Second,If you get stuck while finding bugs just take a break don't leave the program , always keep an eye open on the error which are showing on you'r target.like sql error etc.. </li>
    <br>
     <li>Third,Always test payloads on the input field which you find on you'r website , it can be a bug like cross-site scripting,template injection bug etc...</li>
     <br>
     <li>Fourth,If you find any technology with it's version so first check if it is old version or not , because old versions can be vulnreablity , you can check that using google about that version . </li>
    <br>
   </ol>
   <br>
